##Pig Latin

Pig Latin is NOT a language, it's a long standing language game that children used to speak in code

####How it works

1. If a word starts with a vowel ('a', 'e', i', 'o', 'u') append 'way' to the end of the word
  ie: actual -> actualway

2. If the word starts with a consonant, move all consonants leading up to the first vowel to the end of the word and add an 'ay' to the very end
  ie: drinks -> inksdray

##### Given any word as an input, translate it to pig latin
