Algorithms / Data Structures
You should be able to correctly turn a CSV string into a markdown-formatted table
You should be able to correctly turn a querystring into an object in under 30 minutes

AJAX / DOM
You should be able to write an app that:
makes an AJAX call to Reddit / OMDB
parses the results and displays them on the screen
You should be able to write a page that takes a querystring, and display content based on the querystring
For example, and index page, that shows a search box when there's no q param, and a list of search results when there is a q param
You should be able to write links / forms that send querystrings to pages
You should be able to describe your multi-page AJAX / DOM project, and sequence diagram it
